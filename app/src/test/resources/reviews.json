      "message": "This was a great tour and a highlight of my trip to Berlin. The meeting point was easily accessible, tour guide engaging and informative. The tour took us through parts of the building (it&#039;s so huge it&#039;s impossible to do it all) and uncovered its history, architecture and usage during the Nazi period, WWII and the Cold War, taking in main areas of the airport and added extras such as the roof and basements and bunkers. A great tour for anyone who appreciates architecture and the history of this incredible city. Highly recommend.",

      "message": "Céline was an excellent guide : she knows her subject, has updated informations and took her distances with all the myths you can listen/read about the Tempelhof airport. This 2 hours walk in different rooms and floors was totally great. To see this part of History (and aeronautics) is amazing. A whole empty airpoirt for the group where you can imagine parts of daily history but also see the details of architecture, organization, uses throughout the times etc. Highly recommanded! Be carreful to arrive 10 minutes at least before the visit starts for with your ticket.",
